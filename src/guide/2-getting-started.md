# Getting Started

## Starting from Scratch

The fastest way to get started is to clone the repo or use the npm `npm i nuxt-iam` or `yarn add nuxt-iam` or `npx nuxt-iam` command. This will add a fresh Nuxt 3 installation with the authentication and authorization logic already there. Nuxt IAM works with **Nuxt 3** and is not supported in Nuxt 2.
