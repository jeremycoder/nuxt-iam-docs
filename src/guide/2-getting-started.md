# Getting Started

At a minimum all you need to run Nuxt IAM is a database. Nuxt IAM is a Nuxt application and comes ready to run. All you need to add is a database.

More configuration is required if you need to send emails and use Google authentication.

## Starting from Scratch

The fastest way to get started is to clone the repo or use the npm `npm i nuxt-iam` or `yarn add nuxt-iam` or `npx nuxt-iam` command. This will add a fresh Nuxt 3 installation with the authentication and authorization logic already there. Nuxt IAM works with **Nuxt 3** and is not supported in Nuxt 2.
